This blot art piece was created using Blot, a creative coding environment by Hackclub.

Description:

The artwork features a mountainous landscape bathed in the cool light of the evening. Lush, dark mountains rise from the black ground, their peaks softened by noise functions that add a touch of organic texture. A crescent moon with subtle rings hangs in the sky, adding a touch of mystery to the scene.
